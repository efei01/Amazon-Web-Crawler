# Amazon-Web-Crawler
This is a web crawler I designed with Python using BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape product information from amazon.com. The code for the web crawler itself can be found in web_crawler.ipynb. I defined two functions, one to extract product links from the paginated search results, and the second to collect product data from each individual product page. 

Note: using a VPN or proxy rotator can prevent your IP address from getting banned by amazon.com.
